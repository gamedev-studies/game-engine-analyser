We used a two-sample T-test to determine the number of participants we would need to detect a statistically significant difference in the dependent variables. The two-sample T-test takes four inputs:

- Significance level (alpha): we considered alpha=0.05, which is generally considered adequate for quantitative studies, according to Diehl (http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-540-46505-8).
- Difference (delta): minimum difference in the value of a variable we wish to detect in the study. We considered variables pertinent to each dependent variable.
- Statistical power (power): the probability the study will find a statistically significant difference. We considered power=0.9.
- Standard deviation (s): We considered the values provided in the original study for each dependent variable.
